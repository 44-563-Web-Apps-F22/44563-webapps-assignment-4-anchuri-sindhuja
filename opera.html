    <h4>PHOEBE </h4>  <p> Aye, truly, if he brings the reprieve.</p> 

    <h4>MERYLL</h4>    <p>And not otherwise?</p> 
  
    <h4>PHOEBE</h4>   <p>Well, he's a brave fellow indeed, and I love brave
                      men.</p> 
  
    <h4>MERYILL</h4>    <p>All brave men?</p> 
  
    <h4>PHOEBE</h4>    <p>Most of them, I verily believe! But I hope Leonard
              will not be too strict with me— they say he is a very
              dragon of virtue and circumspection! Now, my dear old
              father is kindness itself </p> 

    <h4>MERYLL </h4> <p>And leaves thee pretty well to thine own ways, eh?
              Well, I've no fears for thee; thou hast a feather-
              brain, but thou'rt a good lass.</p> 
  
    <h4>PHOEBE </h4> <p>  Yes, that's all very well, but if Leonard is going to
              tell me that I may not do this and I may not do that,
              and I must not talk to this one, or walk with that
              one, but go through the world with my lips pursed up
              and my eyes cats down, like a poor nun who has
              renounced mankind— why, as I have not renounced
              mankind, and don't mean to renounce mankind, I won't
              have it— there!</p>
