    PHOEBE    Aye, truly, if he brings the reprieve.

    MERYLL    And not otherwise?
  
    PHOEBE    Well, he's a brave fellow indeed, and I love brave
              men.
  
    MERYLL    All brave men?
  
    PHOEBE    Most of them, I verily believe! But I hope Leonard
              will not be too strict with me— they say he is a very
              dragon of virtue and circumspection! Now, my dear old
              father is kindness itself, and——
  
    MERYLL    And leaves thee pretty well to thine own ways, eh?
              Well, I've no fears for thee; thou hast a feather-
              brain, but thou'rt a good lass.
  
    PHOEBE    Yes, that's all very well, but if Leonard is going to
              tell me that I may not do this and I may not do that,
              and I must not talk to this one, or walk with that
              one, but go through the world with my lips pursed up
              and my eyes cats down, like a poor nun who has
              renounced mankind— why, as I have not renounced
              mankind, and don't mean to renounce mankind, I won't
              have it— there!</h6>
